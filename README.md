Everytime I find a valuable book online that is free, it's never by using a simple query like "Make Your Own Neural Network 1st edition by Tariq Rashid".
Good luck trying to find that, might as well pull out your wallet and get your credit card to pay $117.49

## OR

Just by simply adding a Google's search engine operators like filetype:
We can refine our query like this: "Make Your Own Neural Network 1st edition Tariq Rashid filetype:pdf"

### Output:

"https://davidhason.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5_6278459055300150353.pdf"

Know the purpose is to actually take for granted this url and leverage a system to manage your books, all in one place.
