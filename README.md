## Problem:

Whenever I find a valuable book online that is free, it's never by using a simple query like `"Make Your Own Neural Network 1st edition by Tariq Rashid"`.

Good luck trying to find that, you might as well pull out your wallet and get your credit card to pay $40 - $117.49

## OR

Just by simply adding Google's search engine operators like `filetype:`

We can refine our query like this: `"Make Your Own Neural Network 1st edition Tariq Rashid filetype:pdf"`

### Output:

[Full book in pdf](https://davidhason.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5_6278459055300150353.pdf)

The goal is to than take for granted these types of urls and leverage a library to manage your books, all in one place.
